# DataConveyer_HierarchicalJsonToCsv

DataConveyer_HierarchicalJsonToCsv is a sample console application to demonstate how Data Conveyer translates JSON data
of any hierarchy nesting into a 2-dimensional CSV structure. To do so, Data Conveyer assigns CSV field names confirming to
a dot-notation convention. Specifically, the field name is the same as the Json.NET [Path](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/P_Newtonsoft_Json_JsonReader_Path.htm)
property of the corresponding JSON element.

The application works in reverse as well. Given a CSV file, it will examine the field names according to the notation mentioned above and 
create a JSON file with corresponding hierarchy nesting.

There are several sample input files located in the Data subfolder. They contain data on population, drivers and vehicles by US states.
The data was collected from public sources, such as https://www.census.gov/ or https://www.bts.gov/. Different files sort/group this data
differently, thus forming diffent nesting hierarchies. Sample fragments below illustrate a nested JSON hierarchy and a corresponding
flat CSV structure:

**JSON:**
```
[
  {
    "State": "Alabama",
    "Years": [
      {
        "Year": "2009",
        "Data": {
          "Population": "",
          "Drivers": "3782284",
          "Vehicles": "4610850"
        }
      },
      {
        "Year": "2010",
        "Data": {
          "Population": "4785514",
      ...
```

**CSV:**
```
State,Years[0].Year,Years[0].Data.Population,Years[0].Data.Drivers,Years[0].Data.Vehicles,Years[1].Year,Years[1].Data.Population,Years[1].Data.Drivers,Years[1].Data.Vehicles
Alabama,2009,,3782284,4610850,2010,4785514,3805751,4653840
...
```
